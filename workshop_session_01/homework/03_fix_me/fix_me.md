# Homework - Fix Me
While on master branch use this command `git checkout -b functions` to create a new branch called **fix_me** then do the following:
- Please fix the current source file **main.go**, this file is intentially broken and requires a fix to compile. 
- Run the program with the command `go run main.go` to determine if there are any build errors.
- Using the command `git status` will display changed files.
- Using the command `git add` and then appending the file name shown in `git status` will add the file to git, ready to be commited.
- Using the command `git push <your_repo_name>` will send these changes directly to your repository.
- Open a **Pull Request** from your github account to the current class branch on Thrasher-Corps public repo.
