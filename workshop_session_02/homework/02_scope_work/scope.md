# Homework - Scope
While on master branch use this command `git checkout -b scope` to create a new branch called **scope** then do the following:
- Please add a go source file **main.go** to this folder that demonstrates your understanding of variable scoping by assigning global and local variables to display information to standard output. 
- Run the program with the command `go run main.go` to determine if there are any build errors.
- Using the command `git status` will display changed files.
- Using the command `git add` and then appending the file name shown in `git status` will add the file to git, ready to be commited.
- Using the command `git push <your_repo_name>` will send these changes directly to your repository.
- Open a **Pull Request** from your github account to the current class branch on Thrasher-Corps public repo.
